# Weekly Synthesis

Generate a summary of everything that changed in the Team OS repo this week. Post to Slack so the team stays current.

## When to Use

- Run every Friday afternoon (automate via cron or Claude Code hooks)
- Run manually before Monday standup
- Adjust the day to match your team's timezone and sprint cadence

## What It Does

1. Scans all git commits from the last 7 days
2. Groups changes by folder (product, analytics, engineering, team)
3. Summarizes what was added, updated, or removed
4. Highlights key decisions, customer insights, and metric changes
5. Formats as a Slack-ready message

## Output Format

```markdown
## 📋 Team OS Weekly Synthesis — Week of {Date range, e.g., Apr 28 - May 2}

## If Nothing Changed This Week

Don't skip the synthesis. Post:

```markdown
## 📋 Team OS Weekly Synthesis — Week of {Date}

No changes this week. If decisions were made or customer calls happened, they should be checked in.

Quick reminder: /decision-log-entry after meetings with decisions, /customer-call after calls.
```

This gentle nudge prevents the repo from going silent without being preachy.

## Rules

1. Keep under 500 words. Scan, not report.
2. "Top 3 Things to Know" is the most important section. Prioritize: decisions affecting the whole team > customer insights > metric movements.
3. If Slack MCP connected, post to the team's product channel. If not, save to `product-development/product/meetings/team-bi-weekly/summaries/{YYYY-MM-DD}-weekly-synthesis.md`
4. Tag specific people if a change is relevant to them (using roster from root CLAUDE.md).
5. Include the "New contributors" callout to celebrate adoption.
6. For multi-team setups: each team should run their own `/weekly-synthesis` in their own channel for repo-level changes. The exec-grade rollup across teams (top risks, expansion signals, account health) is the `/portfolio-pulse` skill — see `.claude/skills/portfolio-pulse/SKILL.md`. Pair the two on Friday afternoon for the full picture.
